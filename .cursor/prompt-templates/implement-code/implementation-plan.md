# Feature Implementation Planning Template

## Purpose
In order to make the AI work better, I want to break down feature implementations into smaller and manageable (separate prompts) that are easy to test and easy to validate so that I can commit working code using Git.

## Instructions
For the following feature, help me work on this breakdown and give me the individual prompts that I can give to the AI for each bit of the implementation, one by one.

## Project Context
- **Project Type**: [PROJECT_TYPE] (e.g., inventory optimization, recommendation system, etc.)
- **Technologies**: [TECHNOLOGIES] (e.g., Python, Polars, AWS Lambda, etc.)
- **ML Models**: [ML_MODELS] (e.g., autogluon/chronos-bolt-small, etc.)
- **Infrastructure**: [INFRASTRUCTURE] (e.g., SageMaker, API Gateway, etc.)
- **Current Status**: [CURRENT_STATUS] (e.g., existing APIs, components, etc.)

## Feature Requirements
I want to add [FEATURE_NAME] with the following requirements:
- [REQUIREMENT_1]
- [REQUIREMENT_2]
- [REQUIREMENT_3]
- [REQUIREMENT_4]
- [REQUIREMENT_5]

## Expected Outcome
Please provide:
1. A breakdown of implementation steps
2. Individual prompts for each step that I can use with AI
3. Suggestions for testing and validation at each step
