# Cursor Workflow Rules

This project has been updated to use the auto rule generator from [cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow](https://github.com/bmadcode/cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow).

> **Note**: This script can be safely re-run at any time to update the template rules to their latest versions. It will not impact or overwrite any custom rules you've created.

## Core Features

- Automated rule generation
- Standardized documentation formats
- AI behavior control and optimization
- Agile workflow integration

## Workflow Integration

The core workflow rules are automatically installed in:
- `.cursor/rules/` - Contains all rule files organized by category
- `.cursor/templates/` - Contains document templates for PRD, Architecture, and Stories

These rules are automatically applied when working with corresponding file types.

## Getting Started

1. Review the templates in `.cursor/templates/`
2. Start with creating a PRD using the template
3. Follow the agile workflow steps!
