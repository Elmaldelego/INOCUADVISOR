## Affordable Housing for Students

HKUST provides housing subsidies to its student residents to ensure that the University constantly offers prices below market rates, with financial aid available to students in need. The University provides accommodations to students at rates as low as **12.5%** of the rates offered by outside landlords**:

*The analysis and comparisons are based on the following assumptions:*
- The personal space provided to a student resident by the University or a landlord is approximately 100 square feet with a similar living environment. Married-couple rooms for postgraduates are not included in the calculations as the size of such rooms exceeds the 100 square feet assumption.
- The accommodation provided by the landlord is located near the University campus.
