- Undergraduate

## Description

Eligible applicants who do not receive a hall offer for the Residential Year at the major round of admission exercise will be placed on 2 separate waitlists according to their respective pools: (i) **Local** and (ii) **Non-Local students/Local students with No-Home-Base in Hong Kong**. The waitlist is based on the applicant’s hall point calculated according to the Hall Point System, with a random number assigned to those holding the same points.  

Waitlist rankings will be publicized by the Student Housing and Residential Life Office for students’ checking and will be updated regularly. When bed spaces become available in the respective pool, top-up exercises will be conducted, and students on the waitlists will be contacted with a housing offer based on their ranking on the respective waitlists.
