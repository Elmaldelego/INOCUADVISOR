## Chapter I: Eligibility for Student Accommodation

### Who is entitled to Student Accommodation?
All full-time registered undergraduate (UG) students of HKUST, except students in the categories listed below, are eligible for consideration for limited University housing.

#### Students in the following categories are **NOT** eligible for student housing:
- **Termination of Study**
- **Program Completion**
- **Leave of Study**<span class="color1">*</span>
- **Exchange-Out**<span class="color1">*</span>
- **Extension of Length of Study beyond the Normal Duration** [referencing to AR3.4 of the Academic Regulations; refer to [HERE](https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/academic-regulations-governing-ug-studies) for details]

Once a student's registration status falls into one of the above-mentioned ineligible categories; or a student is no longer a full-time registered UG of the University, any associated University housing offer will be cancelled or adjusted accordingly. Those who are already residents of a student hall will be required to vacate University housing by a specified date.

> *Please note that the admission exercise for each Residential Year is conducted ONCE ONLY. Even if students have unconfirmed leave/exchange plans in the coming Residential Year or their registration status is not active during the specified application period, **these students still need to submit a hall application during the specified application period.**
