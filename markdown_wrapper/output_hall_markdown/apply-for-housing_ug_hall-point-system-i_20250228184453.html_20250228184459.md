Hall places not allocated in the above means will be divided into 2 pools for (i) **Local** and (ii) **Non-Local students/Local students with No-Home-Base in Hong Kong** respectively, based on an average ratio of hall offer results of the recent 3 years. 

Eligible students, not already provided with University housing by other means, will receive hall points according to the following criteria and be prioritized in their respective pool subject to their Local or Non-Local/ No-Home-Base status, mainly based on the rationale to cater for the housing need of students with Hong Kong home base who live far away from HKUST and to facilitate all students in active campus involvement.
