### Hall/ Room Swapping

   - For your swapping request to be justifiable, please note the swap should fulfill the following:
     - a same gender room type,
     - consents from all roommate(s) is/are obtained (if any),
     - the request is approved by the respective Residence Master(s) and Hall Office(s).

7. **When can I apply for swapping?**
   - Swapping period is usually conducted during the check-in period, announcement will be made to eligible residents and on the SHRLO Website. You are encouraged to observe the application deadline in advance and submit your application on time. NO late submission is allowed.

8. **I accepted a hall offer, can I delay check-in procedure until approval of my hall/ room swapping request?**
   - No, only current residents are allowed to swap their bedspaces, which means you must first become a resident by checking in then to participate in swapping. You may consider completing check-in procedure without moving in to minimize the hassle.

9. **Can I swap with residents in different halls?**
   - Yes, inter-hall swapping is allowed. However, new students are NOT allowed to swap to Jockey Club Hall. Exchange students can only swap to the SAME room type. And you are responsible for the hall fee difference if you swap to a room type with higher rate.

10. **There is an empty bed in my friend's room. Can I swap to that empty bedspace?**
    - No, only swapping between occupied bedspaces is allowed. The current empty bedspaces are intended to be available for future topping up exercises (i.e. allocation for waitlisted applicants) due to overwhelming hall-place demand.

11. **If I cannot find my roommate and get his/her consent, can I still submit a swap request?**
    - Please contact your Hall office to confirm whether your roommate’s bedspace is assigned or not. If the bedspace is not yet assigned, you do not need to get the consent. But if the bedspace is assigned, you are supposed to find your own way to contact your roommate. SHRLO may not be able to help with this due to data privacy issues.

12. **Can I swap with a student who withdraws hall residence?**
    - No, you cannot. The resident’s bedspace will return to the central pool of bedspace after hall withdrawal.

13. **Can I submit more than one swapping request?**
    - You are allowed to swap more than once within the swapping period. But you can only submit one swap request each time. No new request can be submitted if there is a pending request or your approved swapping is yet to complete by relocation.
