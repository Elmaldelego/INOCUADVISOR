## Chapter III: Application and Admission Rules

### General Admission Procedures
- General admission procedures apply to all hall applicants. Failure to complete any of the required procedures within the stipulated deadline will result in the application being treated as WITHDRAWN without prior notice.
- All hall applicants must apply via the specified application system, except for Exchange-In students.
- Hall application is conducted once a year, with a clearly specified application period each year.

Hall and Room Allocation will be made by considering residents’ preferences (within the same batch of housing offers), subject to availability. Those who cannot be assigned to any of their preferred hall(s) due to supply and demand imbalance will be assigned on a random basis.
- Applicants are responsible for providing true and accurate information, including all proofs and supporting evidence that facilitates the hall officers in verifying the eligibility for the claim status.
