### Eligibility

1. **I am going to be a Postgraduate student at HKUST, can I apply for student housing?**  
   Full-time full fee paying registered HKUST Research Postgraduate (RPg) students are eligible for student accommodation offered by the University, with exceptionals listed [HERE](https://shrl.hkust.edu.hk/apply-for-housing/pg/eligibility-for-student-accommodation).

2. **If I want to apply for study leave, can I apply hall in the coming residential year?**  
   The admission exercise is conducted ONCE per residential year ONLY. Students who wish to be considered, including those who are currently taking leave/plan to take leave from study, are required to submit their applications during the application period regardless of their current registration status. Application details may vary from different categories of student types, please pay attention to the announcement sent to your HKUST email account.  
   If both your hall application and study leave are successful, you are responsible for informing the Student Housing and Residential Life Office (SHRLO) ([pghousing@ust.hk](mailto:pghousing@ust.hk)) immediately. Otherwise, penalty charges may arise.

3. **I completed an MPhil program in HKUST 10 years ago. Can I apply for hall if I am admitted to a PhD program in the coming Term/Residential Year?**  
   As a full-time full fee paying registered HKUST RPg are eligible for student accommodation offered by the University, you can apply for hall in the coming Term/Residential Year. However, the guaranteed residence is given to RPgs in their first 2 years of RPg careers in HKUST regardless of the number of nights they stay in the hall.

4. **I am going to be a year 2 MPhil student. In the last years, I didn’t apply for hall and I didn’t utilize the housing resources provided by the University. Am I eligible to enjoy guaranteed residence in the coming 2 years?**  
   Guaranteed residence is given to RPgs in their first 2 years of RPg careers in HKUST regardless of the application status and the number of nights they stay in the hall. In other words, you only have one year of guaranteed residence left.

5. **I am granted on-campus accommodation under a 2-year guaranteed residence. However, my supervisor requires me to conduct research outside Hong Kong/internship/exchange in the coming term/residential year. Can I extend the guaranteed residence to the next Term/Residential Year?**  
   Guaranteed residence is given to RPgs in their first 2 years of RPg careers in HKUST regardless of the reason for not claiming the priority and the number of nights they stay in the hall. There is NO extension of guaranteed residence provided to RPgs who conduct research outside Hong Kong/internship/exchange.

6. **My status will be changed to “continuing student” in the Spring Term, can I continue to stay in the student hall?**  
   ONLY full-time full fee paying registered HKUST RPg are eligible for student accommodation offered by the University. Therefore, you are not eligible for student housing and are required to check out by a specific deadline.

### Room Assignment

7. **I want to live with some friends in an apartment, what shall I do?**  
   You are reminded that the room assignment is subject to room availability. If you and your friend(s) would like to live in an apartment, you must fulfill the following to increase your chance of living together:
   - ALL of you opted for the same room type in the Room-Type Preference section of your application form.
   - ALL of you can send all concerned names and student IDs to us via email ([pghousing@ust.hk](mailto:pghousing@ust.hk)) within the application period. Any request after the hall application period will NOT be considered.
   - If you choose a 5-person apartment, indicate which 2 RPgs opt for the double room and which 3 opt for single rooms.
   - However, the number of a 4-person apartment (4 single rooms) is very limited.

8. **I am allocated to a room type which I do NOT want. Is it possible to change the room type?**  
   The bedspaces are randomly assigned in case demand is greater than supply. Normally room change will not be considered unless you have very special circumstances such as medical or mental needs with recent supporting proofs.

9. **How can I apply for the couple room?**  
   Rooms for married couples are available in GGT. Applicants who would like to apply for couple room MUST indicate this room type as their 1st preference in their hall application form and submit the marriage certificate to the hall system within the application period.

### Payment and Early Withdrawal

10. **I am now a resident in one of the PG halls. As I will return to my home in the coming month within the residential period, can I check out the bedspace so that I can skip the hall charge payment during that period?**  
    You are committed to paying the hall charges for the residential period that have accepted irrespective of the actual days they stay. Early withdrawal would be considered case by case and on a term basis. All charges paid are Non-refundable and Non-transferable.

11. **I am a new RPg in the coming Fall Term. Why am I charged for more than a month in the 1st instalment posted to my Student Information System (SIS)?**  
    The 1st instalment of the hall charge for new RPgs will cover both August and September so that most of the RPgs can settle the hall charge by using their PGS automatically.

12. **I sent my confirmation email regarding my early withdrawal to SHRLO on 16 March. In my email, I informed them that I will check-out on 30 March, why my hall charge is adjusted to 30 April?**  
    Early withdrawal requires a written request (email) to SHRLO at least 1.5 MONTHs before your desired move-out date. Check-out date is usually assumed according to the date of receiving your early withdrawal written request.

13. **I am unable to complete the check-in procedures at the assigned hall within 14 days from the hall offer period, what should I do? How much do I need to pay for the hall fee?**  
    If you are unable to check in to the hall within 14 days from the commencement date of the hall offer period, you should email the Student Housing and Residential Life Office at [pghousing@ust.hk](mailto:pghousing@ust.hk) IMMEDIATELY to provide the exact date of your late check-in.
