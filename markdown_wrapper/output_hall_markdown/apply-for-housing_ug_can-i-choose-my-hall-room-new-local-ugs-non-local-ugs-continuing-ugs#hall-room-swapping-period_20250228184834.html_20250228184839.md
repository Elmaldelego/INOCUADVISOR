### For New Local UGs, New Non-Local UGs, Continuing UGs

Applicants may indicate a maximum of 3 hall preferences in the housing application. Hall and Room Allocation will be made by considering residentsâ€™ preferences (within the same batch of housing offers), subject to availability, which has NO relation to the reason for receiving a hall offer (i.e., hall points). Those who cannot be assigned to any of their preferred hall(s) due to the supply and demand imbalance will be assigned on a random basis. In other words, there will be NO GUARANTEE of any specific hall/ room/ bedspace/ roommate.

### Hall/ Room Swapping Period

Those who wish to swap hall/ room with a partner may apply for a swap during the regular swapping period:

- Hall and room swapping period will be conducted once per residential term (Fall term and Spring term). Swapping period details will be communicated via email and posted on the SHRLO website after the official check-in period.
- Swapping only applies to students who are assigned to the same gender room type.
- Applicants must submit a completed Room/Hall Swapping Application form, which includes signed consent from BOTH applicants' respective roommates. Incomplete forms will be treated as INVALID, and the request will be WITHDRAWN with no prior notice.
