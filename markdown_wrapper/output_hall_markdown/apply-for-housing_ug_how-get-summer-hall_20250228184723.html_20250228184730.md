### How to get a Summer Hall
An application link will be available for application submission during the specified application period. Only those who have successfully submitted a hall application within the specified application period will be considered. Kindly note that Exchange-In students are NOT eligible to apply for Summer Hall.

### Admission Priority
Summer residence prioritizes applicants with academic engagements in the Summer term, such as:
- Summer Course
- Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP)
- Industrial Training
- PROGRAM REQUIRED Internship (credit-bearing)/graduating requirement

The remaining places will be randomly assigned to applicants who do not fall into the above categories.

### Verification of Reported Academic Engagements
Applicants who indicated that they have academic engagements in the online application for summer residence must submit relevant proofs. Some examples of the supporting documents required are:
- SIS screenshot showing the enrollment of summer courses
- Document of acceptance for UROP
- Proof from ITC or Screenshot from ITC website showing enrollment of industrial training
- Proof of internship with relevant information showing that internship is credit-bearing or is a graduating requirement

Students should submit relevant documents to substantiate the claim on academic engagements via the online hall system within the hall application period. In case the proofs are NOT YET available but can be supplied later, you should indicate it in the online application form and submit it once available. Failure to submit required proofs may lead to CANCELLATION of the application.

### Can I choose my hall/ room?
Applicants may indicate at least one hall preference in the housing application. Hall and Room Allocation will be made by considering residentsâ€™ preferences, subject to availability. In other words, there will be NO GUARANTEE of any specific hall/ room/ bedspace/ roommate.

Applicants with current Full-Year/ Spring Term Residence should note that they may not be able to stay in the same room, and might be required to relocate to other halls/ rooms for the Summer Residence. Should you be required to relocate to other halls/ rooms, you should receive detailed instructions via email. Penalties will be levied if you fail to move to the designated room by the designated deadline and your hall offer for Summer Residence may be recovered.

### Hall Charges
Hall Charges for Summer Residence are calculated by referencing the rates set in Annual Hall Charges of the same Academic Year and in pro-rata to the residential period for different types of Summer Residence (i.e., CURRENT resident and NEW resident). The amount will be posted to the Student Information System (SIS) in due course and student can view their charge statement via myPortal at [HERE](http://my.ust.hk).

**Failure to settle the hall charges IN FULL by the payment due date will result in the cancellation of the hall offer without prior notification.**

**Payment Method**
1. Payment methods accepted by the University are available [HERE](https://csfu.hkust.edu.hk/payment-methods).
2. After payment at the bank or through online banking, keep the payment record as proof in case verification is needed.
3. If you encounter any financial difficulties that you wish to defer the payment, you may apply to the Scholarship and Financial Aid Office (SFAO) for deferment of the payment of hall charges. Information is available [HERE](https://sfao.hkust.edu.hk/page.php?i=24).
