### BEng in Chemical Engineering  
Chemical Engineering is a discipline in which the principles of physical, chemical, and natural sciences are used to solve applied chemistry-related problems in manufacturing processes and plants. Students learn to design a manufacturing plant; transform raw materials into valuable products; purify the products to meet consumer demands; ensure high-quality standards; automate the plant to make production safe and economical; minimize waste and pollution; market and sell the products at a profit; and work effectively with chemical engineering equipment.

### BEng in Bioengineering  
Bioengineering combines both engineering and the life sciences. Bioengineers use engineering principles and the power of biology to tackle medical challenges and improve human health, as well as a wide range of issues, ranging from energy shortage, food and water security, environmental pollution, and an aging population. The program includes a foundation of mathematics and sciences specially designed for bioengineers and two areas of specialization (data-oriented and molecular-oriented). Graduates will find employment as bioengineering innovators, researchers, clinical scientists, and entrepreneurs.

### BEng in Chemical and Environmental Engineering  
This program emphasizes processes that turn raw materials into valuable products without producing effluents and wastes. All companies handling such processes need environmental engineers with a basic knowledge of chemical engineering to design, control, manage, and operate environmental treatment facilities. This combined degree enables students to understand various industrial processes and realize where environmental control measures can be implemented.

### BEng in Civil Engineering  
Civil engineers play an important role in planning, construction, maintenance, and management of safe infrastructure to make our urban environment more adaptive to the ever-changing climate. Our BEng program covers a broad range of disciplines including structures and materials, geotechnical engineering, water resources, transportation and system sciences, and environmental engineering, providing students with a holistic and balanced curriculum.  

### BEng in Civil and Environmental Engineering  
Environmental quality is a major public concern all over the world. With the rapid economic development in Hong Kong and Asia at large, more resources are being committed to improving and managing our environment. There will be a great need for properly trained environmental engineers to develop smart and sustainable solutions.

### BEng in Computer Engineering  
Computer Engineering focuses on the analysis, design, implementation, and utilization of computer systems, from embedded microprocessors to supercomputers, as well as how they are integrated with other systems to meet the challenges of real-world applications. It bridges the gap between computer science and electronic engineering, offering students balanced training on both hardware and software skills.

### BEng in Computer Science  
Computer Science studies the application of computers in solving important problems in scientific, engineering, and commercial domains. Our BEng program provides a broad education, teaching problem-solving skills to tackle computation problems covering programming, data structures and algorithms, operating systems, and software engineering. Students can then choose to learn diverse areas of computer science, such as databases and data mining, networking, embedded systems, computer graphics, image processing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, computer security, and theoretical computer science.


The BSc in Computer Science (COSC) is uniquely designed to be utilized as one half of a double-major declaration. Students enrolled in COSC are required to be simultaneously enrolled in at least one other major, e.g. Mathematics, Physics, Quantitative Finance, Quantitative Social Analysis, Biotechnology, etc. Students who wish to double-major can either start in Computer Science and declare their second major afterwards, or start in another major and then add COSC. In the former case, you should seek admission to the School of Engineering.
