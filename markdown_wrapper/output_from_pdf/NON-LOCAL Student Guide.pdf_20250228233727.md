## MUST-DO ON ARRIVAL  
### CHECK IF YOUR VISA HAS BEEN VALIDATED UPON ARRIVAL  
On your arrival at the Hong Kong immigration check-point, you will be issued a landing slip which bears your name, travel document number, arrival date, conditions, and limit of stay in Hong Kong. The landing slip should say “Student-permitted to remain until DDMMYYYY” and the name of the Hong Kong University you will be enrolled in (i.e., The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology). Without this landing slip, your entry permit is not activated, and you will not be permitted to register at HKUST.  
When you arrive at the immigration counter or checkpoints, please present your passport/travel document with the student visa, together with the HKUST admission offer letter.  

### CHECK IN TO THE STUDENT HALL  
Upon arrival at HKUST, head directly to your assigned hall for check-in. Please pay attention to the specified date and time stated on your hall offer. Generally speaking, the hall offices are open 24 hours for check-in except Jockey Club Hall or otherwise specified. Bedding and hygiene items, such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, and bath towels, are not provided in student halls. You can bring your own or purchase them when you arrive in Hong Kong.  

### GET YOUR HKUST STUDENT CARD  
You will be notified of the details to complete the registration online in advance. Then follow the instructions provided to obtain your HKUST Student Identity Card upon arrival.  

### CLASS ENROLLMENT  
HKUST school will get in touch with you to provide you with details on class enrollment. You can review the program requirements and the course selection at the links below:  
- [HKUST Program Catalog](https://prog-crs.hkust.edu.hk/ugprog)  
- [HKUST Course Catalog](https://prog-crs.hkust.edu.hk/ugcourse)  

### OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT  
If you will be studying in Hong Kong for longer than a term, it is useful for you to open a bank account. To open a bank account, you need to submit an application in person. Please note that it may sometimes take over a month for the banks to process your application. If you will be under 18 years of age at the time of opening the bank account, banking rules in Hong Kong may require that you have one of your parents with you to sign the related documents.  
In general, the following documents are required for opening a bank account:  
- Passport/Travel document and the landing slip  
- HKUST Student Identity Card  
- Proof of Hong Kong Residential Address (such as confirmation letter issued by the on-campus student hall, showing the hall address)  
- Permanent Address Proof  

### APPLY FOR A STUDENT OCTOPUS CARD  
Degree-seeking full-time students and year-long exchange students under the age of 26 are eligible for the MTR Student Travel Scheme. Exchange students in Hong Kong for one term only are not eligible. A Student Octopus Card would allow you to enjoy concession fares of up to 50% off normal fares.  

The general application is outlined below:  
- Submit an online application through the MTR Website.  
- In the online application, you are required to upload your photo and your HKUST Student Identity Card.  
- You are required to pay for the application fee. The new octopus card will be mailed to the mailing address you provided in the application.

### APPLY FOR A HONG KONG IDENTITY CARD  
If you will be staying in Hong Kong for more than 180 days, you are required by law to apply for a Hong Kong Identity Card (HKID) within 30 days of arrival. If you are 18 or above, you should apply for an adult HKID. If you are under 18, you should first apply for a Juvenile HKID and convert to the adult HKID upon turning 18. Hong Kong law requires that you carry your HKID with you at all times.  
To apply for the HKID, you must go in person to the Registration of Persons Office at the Hong Kong Immigration Department. The HKID for new arrivals is issued free of charge. Bring your passport, identity documents, and the HKUST admission letter to support your application.

### REGISTER WITH YOUR CONSULATE  
You are advised to contact the consulate or embassy of your home country in Hong Kong and inquire about possible citizen registration services. Some consulates and embassies maintain mailing lists or social media accounts for keeping their citizens updated on matters that concern them.

## LIVING IN HONG KONG  
### LANGUAGE  
Locals speak mainly Cantonese while English and Mandarin are widely spoken. All official signs, most commercial materials, and menus are bilingual, while public transport announcements are in Cantonese, English, and Mandarin.  
English is the language of instruction at HKUST, and you can expect to encounter minimal problems communicating in English on campus. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile to learn some Cantonese upon arrival or ideally in advance before traveling to Hong Kong if you really want to understand and live in the culture, interact with the locals, and to get the most out while you are here.  

### WEATHER  
Hong Kong is situated in a subtropical monsoon climate, and extreme weather conditions can occur in Hong Kong during the spring and summer months. These include tropical cyclones (known as typhoons in Asia) and severe rain/thunderstorms.  
Typhoons are categorized into five levels, with 10 being the most severe. Rainstorms are categorized by color, with Black being the most severe. Please refer to the section “Staying Safe” for more information on weather warnings and safety guidelines during severe weather conditions.  

### WATER  
The water supply in Hong Kong is among the safest in the world. But as the quality and maintenance of water pipes varies from building to building, it is suggested that you consume boiled or bottled water.  
[Drinking Water Quality in Hong Kong](https://www.gov.hk/en/residents/environment/water/water/drinkingwater.htm)  

### HOLIDAYS  
Hong Kong has 17 general holidays a year. Most shops and restaurants, major attractions, theme parks, and public transport will operate as usual on most of these days, but banks and offices will be closed. For the Lunar New Year, commercial outlets will usually be closed for a couple of days, and some traditional or family-run businesses may stay closed for up to 2 weeks.

In general, a student visa will be granted with a validity that is in line with your program duration. However, if your travel document will expire in one year’s time from the day you enter Hong Kong, then the limit of stay granted will only be one year. You will need to apply for a student visa extension later on.

You should apply for an extension of stay four weeks before your limit of stay expires. The limit of stay will be extended in line with the remaining duration of your study program, subject to:
- A maximum period of six years upon entry as a student under the same study program in the same institution
- The validity of your travel document

To apply for visa extension, you need to first obtain a testimonial from the HKUST Academic Registry (ARO). With this supporting document, you may apply at the Hong Kong Immigration Department.

Non-local students of full-time locally-accredited programs at degree level or above whose study period is not less than one academic year may take up the following types of employment during their studies:
- Part-time on-campus employment offered by the University and designated on-campus operators for not more than 10 hours per week during term time and 20 hours per week during the winter break
- Summer job from June 1 to August 31 (both dates inclusive)
- Students who wish to take up study-related internships should seek prior endorsement from Department/School and apply for a separate No-Objection Letter from the Hong Kong Immigration Department if they have not been issued with a valid one.

**HKUST Career Center**  
[HKUST Career Center](https://career.hkust.edu.hk/web/page.php?sid=28)


The Hong Kong Immigration Department introduced a scheme called Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates (IANG) to encourage non-local graduates to stay and work as professionals in Hong Kong.

**Non-local fresh graduates**  
Non-local graduates who apply for IANG within six months after the date of graduation (i.e. the date of graduation shown on the Letter of Certification or Graduation Certificate) are classified as fresh graduates. Fresh graduates may apply to stay and work in Hong Kong without having secured an offer of employment upon application. IANG applicants who meet the normal immigration requirements may be granted a 12-month stay with no conditions. 

**Non-local non-recent graduates**  
For graduates who apply for IANG beyond six months after the date of graduation (i.e. the date of graduation shown on the Letter of Certification or Graduation Certificate), they will be classified as non-local non-recent graduates. Non-local non-recent graduates who wish to work in Hong Kong must have secured an offer of employment when they apply for IANG. The applications will be favorably considered as long as the job is at a level commonly taken up by degree holders and the remuneration package is at market level.

## Mainland Chinese Students Traveling Overseas

Mainland Chinese students who wish to travel overseas should ensure they have a valid passport. The passport application should be made to the Public Security Bureau of your province/city or at the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PRC in the HKSAR. The Entry Permit issued by the Hong Kong Immigration Department allows for entry to Hong Kong only, and is not a travel document for traveling overseas.

## Taiwanese Students Re-Entering Hong Kong

Taiwanese students will be issued a single-journey entry permit to take up studies in Hong Kong. After entering Hong Kong on the single entry permit, you may apply for a “Multiple Entry Permit” (MEP) at the Hong Kong Immigration Department and transfer of endorsement onto the MEP to facilitate your future travels to and from Hong Kong.


## PUBLIC HOSPITAL CARE

Students with a valid HKID card will be considered as eligible persons for public charges at public hospitals. The present rate is HK$180 per attendance for accident and emergency treatment, HK$75 admission fee and HK$120 per day for general ward. These are subject to change. You are advised to also bring along your passport containing your valid student visa together with your HKID card.

## INFORMATION ON DISEASES IN THE REGION

**Human Swine Influenza**  
Human swine influenza, otherwise known as H1N1, can spread through coughing and sneezing. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, muscle pain and headache, and in some, diarrhea. As vaccines for human seasonal flu do not provide protection against H1N1 viruses, and they may be fatal, please seek medical advice if you suspect you may have contracted it.

**Avian Influenza**  
Avian Flu (H5N1) is a strain of influenza previously known to infect birds only, but human cases were documented in Hong Kong in 1997 and 2003. It is likely to result in high fever, chest infection, respiratory distress, multiple organ failure and, in some cases, death. The virus is believed to be transmitted from infected live birds to humans. The best protection is to stay away from live poultry.

**Dengue Fever**  
This viral disease transmitted by the Aedes mosquito is found in many Southeast Asian countries. The fever is mild and victims recover within several days. However, multiple infections by different strains of the virus can lead to a more severe infection that can be fatal. The best protection against dengue fever is to prevent the spread of mosquitoes and their bites.

**Cholera**  
Cholera is caused by a group of bacteria commonly found in unclean water. Transmission of the disease occurs mainly through contaminated food, especially seafood. The infection is more prevalent during the summer months. Ensure that all food is cooked thoroughly before consumption, and only drink boiled or bottled water.

**Influenza**  
The “flu season” in Hong Kong usually occurs from January to March and from July to August. Most people recover completely in one to two weeks. The influenza vaccination can help reduce medical complications and death, especially amongst the elderly and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory diseases. Vaccinations should be applied yearly due to the emergence of new viral strains. Please consult your physician if this is required.

### Tips for preventing the spread of disease:
- Strengthen your immune system by maintaining a healthy physical and mental state.
- Observe good personal, food and environmental hygiene.
- When participating in outdoor activities, cover your body and use insect repellent as necessary to prevent mosquito bites.
- Wash your hands frequently with soap. Use hand sanitizers where water is not available.
- Cook pork, poultry and eggs thoroughly before consumption.
- Remove stagnant water from your living environment.
- Cover your nose and mouth with tissue when sneezing and coughing. If you are exhibiting symptoms of respiratory infection, wear a mask.
- If you are running a fever, wear a mask and consult your doctor immediately.
- If you fall ill after returning home from abroad, report your travel history to your doctor.


## PERSONAL WELL BEING

Your first few weeks in Hong Kong may be hectic. During the term, manage your time and finances wisely to avoid unnecessary stress and distress. Take some time to explore Hong Kong, experience the culture, and keep in touch with your family back home. You should also participate in student activities, and discover new interests to make the best of your time in Hong Kong.

### COUNSELING

You are encouraged to consult professional counselors, who are available on campus, should you experience any of the following:
- Emotional instability, depression or anxiety
- Interpersonal tension or conflict
- Maladjustment to university or campus life
- Unsatisfactory academic performance
- Alcohol and/or drug abuse
- Eating disorders

## ALCOHOL

The legal drinking age in Hong Kong is 18. Premises serving alcohol may perform ID checks. In such cases, you will have to provide a government-issued identity card stating clearly your date of birth, such as your passport or HKID.

## SMOKING

HKUST is a non-smoking campus. Smoking is hazardous to your health. Hong Kong law prohibits smoking in most enclosed areas, including restaurants, karaoke boxes, malls and some bars, as well as in most public outdoor areas, including public beaches, swimming pools, transport interchanges, escalators and university campuses.

Any person who smokes or carries a lighted tobacco product in a statutory non-smoking area will be fined up to HK$1,500.

## NARCOTICS

Hong Kong laws regarding the enforcement and penalties for narcotics may be different from that of other countries. You should pay attention to these. In Hong Kong, the following are considered offenses and are liable for conviction:
- Trafficking a dangerous drug (includes selling or distributing a drug)
- Manufacturing a dangerous drug
- In possession of, or smoking, inhaling, ingesting or injecting a dangerous drug
- In possession of any pipe, equipment or apparatus fit and intended for smoking, inhaling, ingesting or injecting a dangerous drug
- Cultivating any plant of the genus cannabis or opium poppy

[Anti-drug Information](https://www.nd.gov.hk/en/antidrug_resources.html)

## FAITH AND RELIGION

Religious freedom is protected under Hong Kong’s Basic Law. While many of Hong Kong’s locals adhere to traditional Chinese faiths such as Buddhism and Taoism, there are numerous other religions in the territory that contribute to its cultural diversity. These include Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Judaism, amongst many others.


Being able to adhere to diet-specific preferences or needs is an important part of staying physically and mentally well when you are living in a new environment. While it may take some time for you to adjust to what is available for your dietary needs in Hong Kong, it is possible as long as you give it a little effort and are open to a little bit of compromise.

## Halal-certified food
Halal certification is granted through the Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong.

## FOOD ALLERGIES/INTOLERANCE
The best way to avoid an allergic reaction to a certain food is to avoid it. Ask the food provider about the ingredients used to make the dish, review the ingredient labels on packaged foods, or eat only what you prepare yourself.

If your food allergies or intolerance can lead to life-threatening symptoms, we advise you to be vigilant when eating out, as the possibilities of cross-contamination in food preparation facilities can sometimes be unavoidable. In addition, you should be aware that different countries have different food labeling laws, which may require products to list only the major items or not require them to list any ingredients at all.

When traveling to a place where you are unfamiliar with the local language, you should carry a card with you that describes your food allergy/intolerance and its resultant symptoms. This card should be in the local language, so that it can be shown to eateries to clearly communicate the details and severity of your allergy/intolerance.


## TIPS WHEN TRAVELING
- Always inform your family and someone in Hong Kong prior to departure. Remember to give them a copy of your contact information if available.  
- Check for travel or health warnings issued for your destination. Get proper immunization if necessary.  
- Ensure that you have all the travel documents, visas and entry permits required for entry to your destination before departure.  
- Purchase travel insurance for the entire duration of your trip.  
- Store your money, travel documents and other valuables in a safe place.  
- Make photocopies of travel documents and keep them separately when you travel.  
- If possible, check the contact details of your country’s consulate/embassy as well as the local emergency number at your travel destination.  

## LOST OR STOLEN PASSPORTS
Should your passport or travel document be lost or stolen in Hong Kong, follow the procedures below:
- Immediately file a report of the stolen document to the Hong Kong Police Force online and keep a print out of this on hand.  
- Inform your consulate in Hong Kong and apply for a new passport. If your consulate is not situated in Hong Kong, you will have to contact the nearest consulate overseas and liaise with them. Remember, you will not be allowed to leave Hong Kong without your travel documents.  
- Obtain a testimonial from the HKUST Academic Registry as proof of your student status at HKUST.  
- Bring your new passport, the testimonial issued by HKUST and the lost report provided by the Hong Kong Police Force to the Extension Section at The Hong Kong Immigration Department to apply for a transfer of the endorsement of your student visa to your new passport.  


## GENERAL SAFETY
Hong Kong enjoys a low crime rate compared to other major cities and is generally considered to be a very safe place. Nevertheless, you should remain vigilant, exercise caution and follow common sense in looking after yourself and your personal belongings.

## LAB SAFETY
All students taking courses that require the use of laboratory facilities and machinery must abide by strict laboratory safety guidelines. Many accidents that occur here are preventable. Remember to observe safety rules and exercise care under all circumstances.

## WEATHER WARNINGS
### Thunderstorm Warning, Typhoon Signals and Rainstorm Warnings
When the Thunderstorm Warning, Typhoon Signal No.8 and/or Black Rainstorm Warning is hoisted, you should take necessary precautions as follows:
- Stay indoors wherever you are and do not leave the building until the signal is lowered and it is safe to do so.  
- Stay away from large windows, structures and objects that are vulnerable to strong wind.  
- Do not swim or engage in any water sport activities. Leave the water and seek shelter.  
- Do not touch aerials, water pipes, wire fences and similar metal installations.  
- Do not handle inflammable materials in open containers.  
- Do not stand on hilltops or near any highly conductive object. Keep away from trees or masts that are likely to be struck by lightning.  
- You should listen to radio and TV broadcasts for weather updates.  

### Landslip Warning
About three to four hundred landslides are reported each year, mostly in the rainy summer season. Occasionally, severe landslides can cause casualties, damage properties and block roads.

Landslip warnings will be issued (by the Hong Kong Observatory in consultation with the Geotechnical Engineering Office) based on the latest weather information.

When the Landslip Warning is issued, local radio and television stations are notified and are requested to broadcast the warning to the public at regular intervals, together with advice on precautions that should be taken.  

When the Landslip Warning is in force, you should stay in a safe shelter. Avoid walking or standing close to steep slopes and retaining walls.

If you receive a notice to evacuate because of landslide danger, or if you believe that your home is endangered by an unstable slope or retaining wall, or overhanging boulders, you should make immediate arrangements to move to a safe shelter.

## TERRORISM
The overall risk of a terrorist attack is considered low in Hong Kong. The guidelines below should be followed in case of any suspected or confirmed terrorist attack:
- If you find something suspicious after opening a parcel or letter, do not panic. Put the parcel down and cover the item with minimal disturbance. Thoroughly wash your hands or body parts that might have been exposed with warm water and soap, and remove potentially contaminated clothing if necessary. Then call the Security Control Center on ext. 8999 or on the direct line 2358 8999. If you are outside the campus, call the police on 999.  
- If you learn about a suspected or confirmed attack in the same building you are in, evacuate in an orderly manner and follow the instructions of security or law enforcement personnel.  
- If there is a suspected or confirmed attack in the vicinity, stay indoors and pay attention to public announcements through TV or radio.  

The University is committed to creating and maintaining a diverse, inclusive and open campus environment in which HKUST members including students are treated with fairness, presented with equality of opportunities, with diversity valued and respected. The University opposes, and will proactively challenge and eliminate, any form of discrimination and harassment, prejudices and biases to ensure a level playing field, regardless of any individual characteristics.

**Magic formula for a happy and enriching life in a diverse community:** 
- Show respect for others, e.g. using inclusive language  
- Be considerate and sensible  
- Stay open-minded  

## Diversity and Equal Opportunities Policy
The Diversity and Equal Opportunities Policy provides an overview of the University’s commitment in building a welcoming, diverse and discrimination and harassment-free environment while the Procedures for Handling Discrimination/Harassment Complaints set out the definitions of discrimination/harassment and mechanism for dealing with allegations or complaints covered by the anti-discrimination ordinances of Hong Kong.
