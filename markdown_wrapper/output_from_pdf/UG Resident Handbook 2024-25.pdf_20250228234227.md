## Welcome Message
The Hall Management staff would like to extend our warmest welcome to you! Our mission is to provide quality management, facilities, and services to our residents. Working with DSTO (Dean of Students’ Office) and other academic departments, we strive to provide a vibrant and diverse living and learning platform for cultural, recreational, social and academic growth for our residents.

Living in the hall community at HKUST will certainly be an amazing experience where you can meet lots of new friends, learn how to live with your roommates, and expose yourself to ideas that you have never encountered. You may even face obstacles and problems that are difficult to solve. Do not feel desperate, as you are not alone in facing these challenges. Many people within our hall community, including your Residence Masters, peers, and hall staff, can offer help and support. You are welcome to speak out and discuss with us in order to find ways to cope with difficulties. This is also a transition to becoming an independent and responsible individual.

The student halls are close to lecture theatres and classrooms, and you can easily access various campus resources. Our office offers a variety of programs that stimulate both educational and social development. You are also encouraged to join activities organized by your Residence Master and hall staff.

We are sure that it will be an unforgettable experience for you to be involved in the hall life at HKUST!

## Introduction
The University believes in total and holistic education. Students are encouraged to take part in extra-curricular activities and to engage in athletic and cultural activities as participants rather than spectators. Residential living on campus is an important means in achieving the educational purpose and development of:
- Interpersonal skills
- Breadth of interests
- Organizational and leadership abilities

The main objective of this handbook is to provide basic information about Undergraduate Halls to all residents with a view to facilitating them in deriving maximum benefit from residential life. The architects and builders have created for us the physical environment in the form of rooms, common areas, and others. It will be you, the residents, through your stay in the hall and participation in activities that will give life and character to the residential environment.

Do make good use of the handbook to explore the facilities and services available. At the same time, do ask yourself in what way, through your participation, efforts, creativity, cooperation, acceptance, and others, you can contribute to the creation of an environment that will bring educational benefit to all.

Halls play a special role in campus life. Being more than a place to sleep and study, halls provide an opportunity for you to make friends with students from other schools and to experience a true sense of community. Each student should act responsibly and honorably and to hold fellow students to the same standard.

## Your Learning Partners

### Residence Masters (RMs)
Halls are under the overall charge of the Residence Masters who provide intellectual guidance and pastoral care to residents; organize activities/programs that aim at enhancing the residential life experience of residents; and resolve conflicts and handle disciplinary matters of the hall. In the undergraduate halls, each Residence Master is assisted by a Residential Life Officer and a team of Hall Tutors who are postgraduate students.

### Residential Life Officers
Residential Life Officers are full-time residential staff who take care of the needs of the residents and provide administrative support to the Residence Masters. They also assist the RMs to plan and organize programs and activities, aiming to enrich students’ residential life and assist with students’ holistic development.

### Hall Tutors
Hall Tutors are postgraduate students of the University who assist the Residence Masters in the provision of pastoral care and intellectual guidance to hall residents as well as in the organization of activities.

### Student Groups
Student groups are formed by residents of UG Halls VI, VII, VIII, and IX to organize student activities for hall residents. They work with the Residence Masters and Residential Life Officers to cultivate a fun, enriching, and rewarding hall living experience. The names of these student groups are:
- Connection Team in UG Hall VI
- Leadership Team in UG Hall VII
- Organizing Team in UG Halls VIII & IX

### House Students’ Associations
In each of UG Halls I-V, there is a House Students’ Association formed by residents and students who work closely with the Residence Masters, Residential Life Officers, and Hall Tutors to organize activities and promote participation in residential life among their members. The names of five House Student’s Associations are:
- The Undergraduate House One Student’s Association, HKUSTSU
- VERTEX, House II Students’ Association, HKUSTSU
- Glacier, House III Students’ Association, HKUSTSU
- Vista, House IV Students’ Association, HKUSTSU
- Endeavour, House V Students’ Association, HKUSTSU

### Student Housing and Residential Life Office (SHRLO)
SHRLO is in charge of the overall management of student halls, including admission, residential life programs, hall operations, and off-campus housing. A team of full-time staff including Residential Life Officers and hall attendants are present and responsible for managing the daily operation of the hall, including resident services and facility management. Hall Offices open from 8:45 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. (except from 7:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.) daily, including weekends and public holidays. After the office hours, only security staff will be stationed at the Service Counter to provide services.

## Programs and Activities
Student halls provide an environment where students can enhance their capacity for growth socially, interpersonally, intellectually, and physically. While students can learn spontaneously through informal interactions and conversations, we provide structured programs and build up intentional community to bring the learning experience to the next level.

The Student Housing and Residential Life Office (SHRLO) brings various stakeholders together to cultivate a supportive and learning-stimulating environment. Each student hall has a unique plan for activities deliberately planned by the Residence Master and staff. Student groups and associations within the halls also play a vital role in making students’ experience a fun and rewarding one. Supplemented by activities that are made available across the halls, students get the most out of their stay, regardless of the length.

### Hall-based Activities
Residence Masters and staff design for each hall a year-round activity plan. Students are warmly welcomed in orientation activities at the beginning of the semester. Throughout the term, learning-stimulating activities based on the aspirations of each hall will be rolled out to enhance individual growth and encourage meaningful interactions among hall residents. Residence Masters strive to offer exciting and rewarding residential programs and activities to all residents. Through this mechanism, comprehensive learning experience to each student is achieved.

Students may involve voluntarily in activities that enhance cultural awareness, social responsibilities, eco-awareness, physical fitness, and other personal growth elements.

### Student-led Activities
SHRLO fosters leadership and responsibility in our students by supporting and collaborating with student groups and associations within the halls. In each of UG Halls I to V, a House Students’ Association is established to promote residential life. There are resident-elected student groups in UG Halls VI to IX that organize activities for their residents.

## How to Get Along with Roommates?
Living with roommate(s) and hall mates from different backgrounds is not a simple task. Efforts need to be made to create a harmonious living environment.

- **Self-introduction upon Moving-in:** Introduce yourself and get to know each other.
- **Work out an Agreement:** It is better to share and agree with roommate(s) on preferences and the “bottom line.”
- **Room Hygiene and Quiet Hours:** Keep your room and common areas clean and tidy. During quiet hours (11 p.m. to 7 a.m.), noise, conversations, or music should not disturb residents in their bedrooms or apartments.
- **Mutual Understanding and Respect:** Do not assume your roommate(s) have the same habits or lifestyle as yours. Respect theirs as they respect yours and learn to accommodate each other. Have an open conversation with them and make the corresponding adjustments.

## How to Make Hall Life More Fruitful?
- **Meet your Residential Life Officer and Hall Tutors:** Find out who they are and tell them your expectations.
- **Take Part in Activities:** Various kinds of hall activities and SHRLO-led programs are organized for you to meet and learn from your hall mates and residents in other halls.
- **Organize Activities:** Grasp the opportunity to plan events for your fellow hall mates to share and learn.
