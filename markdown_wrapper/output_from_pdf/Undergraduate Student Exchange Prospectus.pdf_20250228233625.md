## DISCOVER HONG KONG  
### THE ORIENTAL MARVEL AT YOUR FINGERTIPS  
Situated in the heart of Asia at the southern tip of Mainland China, Hong Kong is a unique place where you will find a fast-paced, 21st-century lifestyle interwoven with local traditions and countryside charms. Here, you can be a part of the city’s hustle and bustle in the morning, unplug with a stroll or hike along a picturesque beach or peak in the afternoon, and come evening, an array of entertainment options awaits. In this city with endless possibilities, you are bound to discover something new around every corner. And you will be glad to know that with consistently low crime rates, Hong Kong is a remarkably safe place, by day and by night.

### RICH HERITAGE AND DIVERSITY  
Hong Kong flourished from a fishing village to an international city with a well blend of cultures. Rich cultural heritage can be observed in culinary, artistic, and architectural aspects. You can visit Tai Kwun, a cultural hub revitalized from the police headquarter complex established in 1864, and appreciate the harmony of a mixture of heritage and contemporary architecture. Or you may take a stroll in Tai-O, a fishing town with stilt house-lined riverbanks with a pungent scent of dried seafood. There are plenty more to discover and you will be amazed to find out how rich Hong Kong’s heritage and diversity is. 

### BREATHTAKING CITYSCAPE AND NATURAL SCENERY  
Albeit a compact city, Hong Kong has the perfect balance of cityscape and natural attractions. In fact, nearly 75% of Hong Kong’s land remains in a natural state, with most of these areas comprised of beautiful country parks, Geoparks and nature reserves. Thanks to our efficient public and private transportation network, most attractions are easily accessible and within reach. One of the first activities that many visitors do is to visit the Victoria Peak. There you can enjoy a spectacular view of the Victoria Harbor and our world-famous skyline. Then head downtown and explore the nooks and crannies of this marvelous city. You never know what you can discover next. Hong Kong also houses an unparalleled range of ecosystems and natural landscapes. From UNESCO Global Geoparks which depicts unique landforms to beautiful country parks, wetlands to outlying islands, Hong Kong is filled with natural marvels for you to enjoy. 

### GREAT FOOD AND SHOPPING  
Hong Kong is without doubt a paradise for shopping and dining. From local street stalls to fine dining to cuisine from all parts of the world – you name it, we’ve got it. Visitors are also fascinated by the endless opportunities for discovering shopping treasures, whether in bargain alleys and roadside markets or designer boutiques and glitzy malls. With its 24/7 lifestyle, this vibrant city has something for everyone.

### TOP-TIER TRANSPORTATION NETWORK  
With a highly developed, sophisticated and reliable subway system, paired with convenient buses, trams and ferries, Hong Kong’s first-rate public transport system puts every corner within easy reach. Not to mention that with an Octopus Card, you can gain access to all these public transport without the hassle of fumbling for loose change. So while you are exploring the city, a nearby nature reserve or a sleepy fishing village, rest assured that Hong Kong offers all the conveniences of a world-class city to live in.
