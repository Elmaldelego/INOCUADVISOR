## Welcome Message
The Hall Management staff would like to extend our warmest welcome to you! Our mission is to provide quality management, facilities, and services to our residents. Working with DSTO (Dean of Students’ Office) and other academic departments, we strive to provide a vibrant and diverse living and learning platform for cultural, recreational, social and academic growth for our residents.

Living in the hall community at HKUST will certainly be an amazing experience where you can meet lots of new friends, learn how to live with your roommates, and expose yourself to ideas you have never encountered. You may even face obstacles and problems that are difficult to solve. Do not feel desperate; you are not alone in facing these challenges. Many people within our hall community, including your Residence Masters, peers, and hall staff, can offer help and support. You are welcome to speak out and discuss with us to find ways to cope with difficulties. This is also a transition of becoming an independent and responsible individual.

The student halls are close to lecture theatres and classrooms, and you can easily access various campus resources. Our office offers a variety of programs that stimulate both educational and social development. You are also encouraged to join activities organized by your Residence Master and hall staff.

We are sure that it will be an unforgettable experience for you to be involved in the hall life at HKUST!

## Introduction
The University believes in total and holistic education. Students are encouraged to take part in extra-curricular activities and to engage in athletic and cultural activities as participants rather than spectators. Residential living on campus is an important means of achieving educational purposes and development of:
- Interpersonal skills
- Breadth of interests
- Organizational and leadership abilities

The main objective of this handbook is to provide basic information about Undergraduate Halls to all residents to facilitate them in deriving maximum benefit from residential life. The architects and the builders have created the physical environment in the form of rooms, common areas, and others. It will be you, the residents, through your stay in the hall and participation in activities that will give life and character to the residential environment.

Make good use of the handbook to explore the facilities and services available. At the same time, do ask yourself how you can contribute to creating an environment that will bring educational benefits to all.

Halls play a special role in campus life. Being more than a place to sleep and study, halls provide an opportunity for you to make friends with students from other Schools and to experience a true sense of community. Each student should act responsibly and honorably and hold fellow students to the same standard.

### Residence Masters (RMs)
Halls are under the overall charge of the Residence Masters who provide intellectual guidance and pastoral care to residents, organize activities/programs that aim at enhancing the residential life experience of residents, and resolve conflicts and handle disciplinary matters of the hall. In the undergraduate halls, each Residence Master is assisted by a Residential Life Officer and a team of Hall Tutors who are Postgraduate students.

## Hall Management
### Residential Life Officers
Residential Life Officers are full-time residential staff who take care of the needs of the residents and provide administrative support to the Residence Masters. They also assist the RMs in planning and organizing programs and activities, aiming to enrich students’ residential life and assist with students’ holistic development.

### Hall Tutors
Hall Tutors are postgraduate students of the University who assist the Residence Masters in providing pastoral care and intellectual guidance to hall residents as well as in the organization of activities.

### Student Groups
Student groups are formed by residents of UG Halls VI, VII, VIII, and IX to organize student activities for hall residents. They work with the Residence Masters and Residential Life Officers to cultivate a fun, enriching, and rewarding hall living experience. The names of these student groups are:
- Connection Team in UG Hall VI
- Leadership Team in UG Hall VII
- Organizing Team in UG Halls VIII & IX

### House Students’ Associations
In each of UG Halls I-V, there is a House Students’ Association formed by residents and students who work closely with the Residence Masters, Residential Life Officers, and Hall Tutors to organize activities and promote participation in residential life among their members. The names of five House Student’s Associations are:
- The Undergraduate House One Student’s Association, HKUSTSU
- VERTEX, House II Students’ Association, HKUSTSU
- Glacier, House III Students’ Association, HKUSTSU
- Vista, House IV Students’ Association, HKUSTSU
- Endeavour, House V Students’ Association, HKUSTSU

### Student Housing and Residential Life Office (SHRLO)
SHRLO is in charge of the overall management of student halls, including admission, residential life programs, hall operations, and off-campus housing. A team of full-time staff including Residential Life Officer and hall attendants are present and responsible for managing the daily operation of the hall, including resident services and facility management. Hall Offices are open from 8:45 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. daily, including weekends and public holidays. After the office hours, only security staff will be stationed at the Service Counter to provide services.

## Programs and Activities
Student halls provide an environment where students can enhance their capacity for growth socially, interpersonally, intellectually, and physically. While students can learn spontaneously through informal interactions and conversations, structured programs are provided to build an intentional community to bring the learning experience to the next level.

The Student Housing and Residential Life Office (SHRLO) brings various stakeholders together to cultivate a supportive and learning-stimulating environment. Each student hall has a unique plan on activities deliberately planned by Residence Master and staff. Student groups and associations within the halls also play a vital role in making students’ experience fun and rewarding. Supplemented by activities made available across the halls, students maximize their stay, regardless of the length.

### Hall-Based Activities
Residence Masters and staff design a year-round activity plan for each hall. Students are warmly welcomed in orientation activities at the beginning of the semester. Throughout the term, learning-stimulating activities based on each hall's aspiration will be rolled out to enhance individual growth and encourage meaningful interactions among hall residents. Residence Masters strive to offer exciting and rewarding residential programs and activities to all residents, achieving a comprehensive learning experience.

### Student-Led Activities
SHRLO fosters leadership and responsibility in our students by supporting and collaborating with student groups and associations within the halls. House Students’ Associations promote residential life, and resident-elected student groups in UG Halls VI to IX organize activities for their residents.
