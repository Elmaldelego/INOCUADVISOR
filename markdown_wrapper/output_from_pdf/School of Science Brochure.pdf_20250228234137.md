## Axonal Regeneration and Rewiring in Adult Central Nervous System 
**(PI: Prof. Kai LIU)**

Neurotrauma, such as brain or spinal cord injury, can cause neurological deficits due to limited functional recovery caused by a lack of successful axonal regeneration and rewiring. This Collaborative Research Fund project aims to use a newly established optic tract lesion model to study functional reconnection. 

Prof. Kai Liu and his team plan to use a novel combination strategy to:
- Boost the intrinsic growth capacity of retinal ganglion cells to regenerate retinal axons across the optic tract lesion site.
- Reinnervate target neurons in the brain.
- Restore light reflex.

The goal is to enhance functional recovery and understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying axon regeneration and functional rewiring. Successful completion of this project will help establish strategies to rebuild disconnected neural circuits after brain injuries and improve understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that mediate functional reconnection after central nervous system injuries.

## Stem Cell-niche Interactions in Tissue Maintenance and Engineering 
**(PM: Prof. Ting XIE)**

Stem cells can replicate and differentiate into specialized cells, supporting normal development and maintaining tissue homeostasis in adults. They serve as potential treatments for degenerative diseases, cancer, and age-related deterioration. By combining stem cells with biomaterial scaffolds, transplantable tissues or organs can be generated to treat degenerative diseases. However, the regulation of stem cell activities inside intact tissues is not well understood.

This Theme-based Research Scheme project aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying stem cell maintenance and differentiation, along with aging in model organisms like:
- Drosophila
- Zebrafish
- Mice

A team of investigators from HKUST, HKU, and CUHK will study how the microenvironment controls stem cell behaviors and functions using advanced genomic, genetic, molecular, biochemical, and developmental approaches.

## A Stem Cell Approach to Dissect the Molecular Basis of Neurodegenerative Diseases 
**(PC: Prof. Nancy IP; Deputy PC: Prof. Zhenguo WU; Co-PIs: Profs. Tom CHEUNG, Amy K. T. FU, Kwok On LAI, Robert Z. QI, Jianan QU, Zilong WEN, Yung Hou WONG, Jun XIA, Wing Ho YUNG, Mingjie ZHANG; Co-investigators: Kenny CHUNG, Bo FENG, Jufang HE, Xuhui HUANG, Karl TSIM)**

A cross-institutional research project led by HKUST was awarded HK$31.2 million in 2018 to develop new and innovative therapies for the treatment of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). 

This Theme-based Research Scheme (TRS) project aims to:
- Dissect the pathological mechanism underlying AD using state-of-the-art iPSC-derived platforms and CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing technologies.

The project builds upon a previous TRS-funded research project that identified:
- Regulatory mechanisms for the differentiation and proliferation of neural stem cells.

To date, 94 publications have resulted, pushing our understanding of the disease forward. The project aims to bring us closer to the development of novel therapies, including personalized medicine, that can ameliorate or even reverse the devastating effects of AD, improving the quality of life for those affected.

## Molecular Regulation of Quiescence and Early Activation in Muscle Stem Cells
**(PM: Prof. Zhenguo WU)**

In vertebrates, adult muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) are crucial for muscle regeneration after injury, transitioning from a quiescent state to re-entering the cell cycle to differentiate and repair the damaged muscle. The transition from quiescent MuSCs to cycling myoblasts is tightly regulated, and dysregulation during this period can result in severe muscle regeneration defects.

This research project proposes to:
- Investigate the molecular, cellular, and mouse-based mechanisms that regulate the transition of adult quiescent MuSCs to cycling myoblasts upon muscle injury.

The results of this study could lead to a better understanding of the regulation of MuSC and help develop MuSC-based regenerative medicine for muscle diseases, including muscle atrophy (e.g., sarcopenia) in the elderly.

## Energy and Dynamics of Grain Boundaries Based on the Underlying Microstructures 
**(PI: Prof. Yang XIANG)**

Grain boundaries are important interfaces between grains with different orientations in polycrystals, and their properties affect the mechanical and plastic behaviors of materials. Existing models for grain boundary dynamics neglect important microscopic structures and mechanisms.

In this project, continuum models were developed to:
- Incorporate the underlying microstructure of line defects in grain boundaries, including both grain boundary and line defect densities.
- Consider the stress field due to long-range elastic interaction between line defects.

Efficient numerical methods were developed to handle the computation of nonlocal and singular stress fields. Continuum models were also developed for the dynamics of triple junctions in the grain boundary network microstructure of polycrystalline materials.

## Geometric Landscape Analysis of Some Non-Convex Optimizations 
**(PI: Prof. Jianfeng CAI)**

Non-convex optimization is a powerful tool for solving scientific and engineering problems, including low-rank approximation and deep neural network training. Recent research has shown that many non-convex functions in high-dimensional data analysis have no poor local minima, enabling efficient and effective solutions with theoretical guarantees.

In this project, the landscape of non-convex optimization arising from phase retrieval, a fundamental problem in imaging techniques, was investigated. The findings revealed:
- A family of non-convex optimizations for phase retrieval can have a benign landscape, meaning all local minima are global and all other critical points have negative directional curvatures.

This supports the development of new efficient algorithms for solving phase retrieval problems.

**(PI: Prof. Alex WYATT)**

In collaboration with researchers from various institutions, recent findings have demonstrated how differences in internal-wave exposure across coral reef depths may support cryptic diversity in the reef coral *Pocillopora* spp. 

By creating different thermal environments on reefs, internal waves might:
- Promote more resilient reefs by increasing the diversity of corals and thus their responses to disturbances such as mass bleaching events.

**(PC: Prof. Jensen LI; Co-PIs: Profs. Che Ting CHAN, Wing Yim TAM)**

This Collaborative Research Fund project aims to investigate how non-Hermitian physics can be used to manipulate wave propagation in optical and acoustic systems. 

Recent explorations predict that:
- Loss and gain within non-Hermitian systems play important roles for wave propagation due to the appearance of exceptional points.

These exceptional points affect the system response in unique ways, creating limitless potential applications, including:
- Enhanced sensing
- Laser-mode selection
- Unidirectional invisibility

The project explores new geometric structures of exceptional points, metasurfaces equipped with exceptional points, and dynamically tunable non-Hermitian systems.

**PI:** Prof. Berthold JÄCK

## Quantum Science

### New Phases of Quantum Matter in Engineered Atomic Systems
**PI:** Prof. Gyu Boong JO

This Collaborative Research Fund project aims to search for new quantum matter and understand the underlying physics in engineered atomic systems. Prof. Gyu Boong Jo and his team will quantum-simulate fundamental Hamiltonians with non-trivial topology, interactions, and dissipations, and develop advanced tools and methods for emulating new phases of quantum matter. The project will use various state-of-the-art platforms in tabletop experiments and collaborate with theoretical groups. The goal is to create, characterize, and understand the physical principles behind new quantum matter. The research is highly interdisciplinary and requires a collaborative approach, which will contribute to a valuable workforce in quantum science and strengthen the research capacity of Hong Kong.

### Quantum Sensing of Phenomena under Extreme Conditions
**PI:** Prof. Sen YANG

Extreme conditions like ultra-low temperatures and high magnetic fields are frequently required for the elimination of thermal noise and fluctuations to unravel the underlying intrinsic physics. For example, cooling down solid state quantum computing nodes made of point defect or dopant to tens of milli-Kelvin temperatures will quench the relaxation channels which hamper intrinsic long decoherence time and manipulate coupling with photon and phonon fields in a controlled manner. Furthermore, pressure is a clean, continuous, and systematic tuning parameter among the competing ground states in strongly correlated electron systems such as superconductivity and magnetism. Sensing with qubits and novel quantum measurement techniques can provide higher resolution and sensibility. In this project, Prof. Sen Yang and his team use qubit based on point defect in diamond to realize sensing under extreme conditions.
