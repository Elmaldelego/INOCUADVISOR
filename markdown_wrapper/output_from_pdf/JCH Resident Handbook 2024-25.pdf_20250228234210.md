## Welcome Message

The Hall Management staff would like to extend our warmest welcome to you! Our mission is to provide quality management, facilities, personnel, services and learning programs to our residents. Working with DSTO (Dean of Students’ Office) and other academic departments, we strive to provide a vibrant and diverse living and learning platform for cultural, recreational, social and academic growth for our residents.

Living in the hall community at HKUST will certainly be an amazing experience where you can meet lots of new friends, learn how to live with your roommates, and expose yourself to ideas that you may have never encountered. You may face obstacles and problems that are difficult to solve. Do not feel desperate, as you are not alone in facing these challenges. Many people within our hall community, including your Residence Masters, peers, and hall staff can offer help and support. You are welcome to speak out and discuss with us in order to find ways to cope with difficulties. This transition is about becoming an independent and responsible individual.

Our office offers a variety of programs that stimulate both educational and social development. You are also encouraged to join various activities organized by our hall staff. We are sure that being involved in the hall life at HKUST will be an unforgettable experience for you!

## Introduction

The University believes in total and holistic education. Students are encouraged to take part in extra-curricular activities and to engage in athletic and cultural activities as participants rather than spectators. Residential living in hall is an important means in achieving the educational purpose and the development of:
- Interpersonal skills
- Breadth of interests
- Organizational and leadership abilities

Hall plays a special role in campus life. Being more than a place to sleep and study, the hall provides an opportunity for you to make friends with students from other Schools and to experience a true sense of community. Each student is charged with the responsibility to act honorably and to hold fellow students to the same standard.

The main objective of this handbook is to provide all residents basic information about Jockey Club Hall with a view to facilitating them in deriving maximum benefit from residential life.

The architects and builders have created a physical environment in the form of rooms, common areas, and others. It will be you, the residents, through your stay in the hall and participation in activities, that will give life and character to the residential environment. 

Do make good use of the handbook to explore the facilities and services available. At the same time, do ask yourself in what way, through your participation, efforts, creativity, cooperation, acceptance, and others, you can contribute to the creation of an environment that will bring educational benefit to all.

## Tips for Living in a Shared Apartment
- Get to know your apartment-mates: Initiate a group conversation (e.g., through a tele-chat group or face-to-face) to discuss routines and boundaries for a pleasant living experience.
- Respect personal property and space: Always ask for permission before using others’ belongings and be mindful of their privacy.
- Respect quiet hours (11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.): Be considerate of other residents’ need for rest during designated quiet hours.
- Maintain mutual understanding and respect: Do not assume your apartment-mates have the same habits or lifestyle as you. Respect theirs as they respect yours and learn to accommodate each other. Have an open conversation with them and make the corresponding adjustments.
- Keep shared spaces organized and accessible for everyone: Avoid storing bulky items such as luggage or paper boxes in the living area. Monthly apartment inspections can help ensure tidiness and address any issues promptly.
- Establish a cleaning and garbage disposal schedule: Create a plan for everyone to contribute to maintaining a clean and tidy environment. While contract cleaners will clean the common areas twice a month, it is important for residents to take responsibility for day-to-day cleanliness. Assign specific tasks or rotate responsibilities to ensure fairness.
- Communicate on the apartment air-conditioning charge paying: Have an open discussion with your apartment-mates about how the payment for the apartment or bedroom air conditioning will be managed.
- Set house rules for visitors: Clearly communicate expectations and guidelines for visitors and make necessary arrangements in advance.
- Seek advice from Hall Tutors: Your Hall Tutor can provide support and advice related to your living situation, as well as address any academic or personal challenges you may encounter.

## How to Make Hall Life More Fruitful?
- Meet your Residential Life Officer and Hall Tutors: Find out who they are and tell them your expectations.
- Take Part in Activities: Various kinds of hall activities and SHRLO-led programs are organized for you to meet and to learn from your hall mates and other residents in on-campus halls.
- Organize Activities: Grasp the opportunity to plan events for your fellow hall mates to share and to learn.

## How to Live a Green Hall Life?
- Switch off light, air conditioner, and other electronic appliances when not in use.
- Reduce water wastage by turning off dripping taps.
- Reduce water consumption by spending less time in the shower.
- Recycle paper, clothes, and other resources whenever possible.
- Support the environmentally friendly programs and activities organized by SHRLO and the Management Office.
- Load the laundry machines to their full capacity, it takes less energy to do one big load than two smaller ones.

## Network Connection
The Residential Network (ResNet) is the service for hall residents provided by the Information Technology and Services Center (ITSC). Both Wired ResNet and Wireless ResNet are available with the technology to ensure reliable network connection.
