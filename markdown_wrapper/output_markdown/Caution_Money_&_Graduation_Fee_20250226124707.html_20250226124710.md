## Guide Resource

### Caution Money
Each student is required to pay a deposit of $400 as caution money on first registration. Charges will be made against this deposit if there are any unpaid claims against the student, such as outstanding library dues. The balance will be refunded if the student leaves the University before graduation. At graduation, the student is required to restore the balance of the caution money to its original level and the full amount of the caution money will be transferred toward the graduation fee.

### Graduation Fee
Upon completion of the program of study and before the degree or diploma is awarded, each student is required to pay a graduation fee. The fee is normally settled by transferring the full amount of the caution money.
