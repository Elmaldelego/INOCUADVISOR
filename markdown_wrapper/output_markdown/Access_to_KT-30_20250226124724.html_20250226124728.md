## Guide Resource

Access to KT-30 is restricted to faculty and students who have classes in the center during the academic term. Please follow the procedure below to gain access to the center:

1. Access to KT-30 is via the main entrance of Tower 1 of the Millennity.
2. Take the elevators to the 9th floor and then take the escalator to the lobby on the 10th floor.
3. Open the Work e-asy* app and use [QRcode](https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/sites/default/files/2025-01/Enter%20via%20QRcode.mp4) or [eAccess](https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/sites/default/files/2025-01/Enter%20via%20eAccess.mp4) (with Bluetooth on) to pass through the turnstile.
4. As you pass through the turnstile, note the elevator assigned to you, and enter the corresponding elevator.
5. Once inside the correct elevator, it will automatically take you to the 30th floor.
6. Upon arriving on the 30th floor, it is recommended that you scan the QR code generated by the HKUST QR Code app or tap your physical HKUST ID card on the door access control to enter KT-30.

**To Note:**

- Only **registered** personnel can pass through the turnstile. Faculty members with assigned teaching duties and students who were enrolled before the start of the term will be pre-registered for Work e-asy. A confirmation email, which includes the login credentials, will be sent before the term begins. Students who enroll during the add/drop period may need to register at the Concierge located on the 10th floor to obtain a visitor badge, which is necessary for accessing the 30th floor.
- To use QRcode or eAccess, you need to download the [Work e-asy](https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/sites/default/files/2025-01/work_easy.pdf) app from either [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaishing.officeTowerApp) or [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/hk/app/%E8%BE%A6%E5%85%AC%E6%98%93-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF/id1465055409) **in advance**.
